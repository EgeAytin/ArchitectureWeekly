Ukraine is still under brutal Russian invasion. A lot of Ukrainian people are hurt, without shelter and need help.** You can help in various ways, for instance, directly helping refugees, spreading awareness, putting pressure on your local government or companies. You can also support Ukraine by donating e.g. to [Red Cross](https://redcross.org.ua/en/), [Ukraine humanitarian organisation](https://savelife.in.ua/en/donate/). You may also consider joining [Tech for Ukraine](https://techtotherescue.org/tech/tech-for-ukraine) initiative.
